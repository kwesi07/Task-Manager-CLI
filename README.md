Task Manager CLI

Description

A C++ command-line application for managing tasks, allowing users to add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Tasks are stored in a JSON file (tasks.json) using the nlohmann/json library, ensuring persistent data storage. This project demonstrates proficiency in C++ programming, file I/O, and JSON handling, suitable for task organization and portfolio showcasing.

Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have:





C++ Compiler: g++ (part of GCC) or any C++17-compatible compiler. Recommended:





Windows: Install MinGW from mingw-w64.org or use MSYS2.



Mac: Install Xcode Command Line Tools (xcode-select --install) or Homebrew (brew install gcc).



Linux: Install GCC (sudo apt install g++ on Ubuntu/Debian).



CMake: For building the project (optional but recommended). Download from cmake.org or install via package manager (e.g., brew install cmake on Mac, sudo apt install cmake on Linux).



Git: For version control. Download from git-scm.com if needed.



Text Editor: VS Code, CLion, or any editor for writing C++ code.



Internet Connection: To download the nlohmann/json library.

Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Task Manager CLI. The process takes approximately 15–30 minutes.

Step 1: Create the Project Repository





Create a project folder:

mkdir Task-Manager-CLI
cd Task-Manager-CLI



Initialize a Git repository (for GitHub):

git init

Create a repository on github.com and link it:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Task-Manager-CLI.git

Step 2: Install Dependencies





Verify C++ Compiler: Check if g++ is installed:

g++ --version

If not installed, follow the platform-specific instructions above.



Download nlohmann/json:





The project uses the nlohmann/json library for JSON handling.



Download the single header file (json.hpp) from the latest release: github.com/nlohmann/json/releases.



Place json.hpp in a folder named include in your project (e.g., Task-Manager-CLI/include/json.hpp).



Alternatively, create the folder and download directly:

mkdir include
curl -L https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.3/json.hpp -o include/json.hpp

Step 3: Add the Source Code





Create a file named task_manager.cpp in the Task-Manager-CLI folder.



Copy the following code into task_manager.cpp (provided below in the next section).



Create a CMakeLists.txt file for easy compilation:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(TaskManagerCLI)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
include_directories(include)
add_executable(task_manager task_manager.cpp)

This configures the project to use C++17 and include the json.hpp header.

Step 4: Compile and Run the Program





Build the project using CMake:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

This generates an executable named task_manager (or task_manager.exe on Windows).



Run the program:

./task_manager  # On Mac/Linux
task_manager.exe  # On Windows



Interact with the CLI:





A menu will appear with options to add, view, update, delete, or mark tasks as complete.



Tasks are saved to tasks.json in the project folder.

Step 5: Upload to GitHub





Add files to Git:

git add task_manager.cpp CMakeLists.txt include/json.hpp tasks.json README.md
git commit -m "Add Task Manager CLI in C++"



Push to GitHub:

git push origin main

Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, try these solutions:





Compiler Not Found:





Ensure g++ is installed and accessible (g++ --version).



On Windows, add MinGW’s bin folder to your PATH (e.g., C:\MinGW\bin).



json.hpp Not Found:





Verify json.hpp is in the include folder.



Check that include_directories(include) is in CMakeLists.txt.



CMake Errors:





Install CMake if missing (brew install cmake on Mac, sudo apt install cmake on Linux).



Run cmake .. from the build folder.



No Tasks Saved:





Ensure the program has write permissions in the project folder.



Check if tasks.json is created after adding a task.



Program Crashes:





Verify your C++ compiler supports C++17.



Share the error message for specific guidance.

Enhancing Smooth Use





Automate Builds: Use make (generated by CMake) to rebuild after code changes:

cd build
make



Backup Tasks: Copy tasks.json before testing to avoid data loss.



Extend Functionality: Add features like task categories or due dates (consult for code).



Portfolio Ready: The project showcases C++ file I/O and JSON parsing, ideal for your CV.

Sample Output

After running the program, interact with the menu:

Task Manager CLI
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Update Task
4. Delete Task
5. Mark Task Complete
6. Exit
Enter choice: 1
Enter task description: Finish project
Task added successfully!

The tasks.json file will contain:

[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "description": "Finish project",
        "completed": false
    }
]

Notes





Ethical Use: This is a local application with no external data scraping, ensuring compliance with ethical standards.



Maintenance: The nlohmann/json library is stable, but check for updates periodically.



Portfolio: Add this project to your CV to highlight C++ skills.
