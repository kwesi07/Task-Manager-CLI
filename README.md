Task Manager CLI

Description

A sophisticated C++17 command-line application for collaborative task management, featuring task creation, viewing, assignment, and iCalendar export, with persistent storage in a SQLite database. Includes user roles (Admin/Member), task categories, due dates, priorities, and a cron-like scheduler for reminders. Designed for real-world productivity, integrating with calendar apps and mimicking enterprise tools like Trello. Showcases advanced C++ skills, database management, and system design.

Features





Manage tasks with descriptions, categories (Work, Personal, Study), due dates, priorities, and user assignments.



Support multiple users with Admin/Member roles for collaborative workflows.



Store data in a SQLite database for scalability.



Export tasks to iCalendar (.ics) for integration with Google Calendar.



Automated due task reminders via a cron-like scheduler.



Robust error handling with file-based logging.



Table-based CLI display for enhanced usability.

Setup Instructions





Create project folder:

mkdir Task-Manager-CLI
cd Task-Manager-CLI



Initialize Git:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/kwesi-owusuofori/Task-Manager-CLI.git



Install dependencies:

mkdir include
curl -L https://www.sqlite.org/2023/sqlite-amalgamation-3410200.zip -o sqlite.zip
unzip sqlite.zip
mv sqlite-amalgamation-3410200/sqlite3.c include/
mv sqlite-amalgamation-3410200/sqlite3.h include/
rm -rf sqlite.zip sqlite-amalgamation-3410200



Add source files:





Save task_manager.cpp, CMakeLists.txt, and README.md.



Ensure include/sqlite3.c and include/sqlite3.h are present.



Build:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .



Run:

./task_manager  # Mac/Linux
